This is me testing that I cant do what I want to do for some reason beyond the
possibility that I am doing it wrong.

That was a very complicated sentence to write for someone who has been bombing through tax
computations for 6 hours. Non stop. At least with coffee. Always with coffee.

What would I do without coffee.

Sleep?

Possibly on a tax computation.

Update: I am still not sure if I am doing it wrong.

Another update: Ok. It turns out that I am not doing it wrong, but I need to do it
differently.
